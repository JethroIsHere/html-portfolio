    <h1>My Top 3 Movies of all Time</h1>
    <h2>Of course, my favorites</h2><hr>
    <h3>Shrek Forever and After</h3>
    <p>No more elaboration, this is my all time favorite as it concluded my journey as a Shrek fan</p>
    <h3>Raya and the Last Dragon</h3>
    <p>We all must learn to forgive one another, and work together for the betterment of everyone</p>
    <h3>Jujutsu Kaisen 0</h3>
    <p>The best since we get to see Yuta's past, and how the Jujutsu Kaisen world worked before Yuji Itadori's presence.</p>
